# MEMT680_Project

##Background

The project is based on the topic of flow capacitive deionization (FCDI), a method of water desalination that is electrically driven and more energy efficient compared to reverse osmosis (RO).

These parallel electrodes act similar to parallel plate capacitors. Once polarized, the flowable electrodes capture ions of the opposite charge, thereby removing salt from the feed solution and 

##Project Goals

The project is split into a primary and secondary object:
1) The primary objective is to create a dashboard capable of visuallizing and packaging the real-time experiments
2) The secondary objective is to explore which algorithms would be best suited for the FCDI application
